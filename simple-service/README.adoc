= Simple test service with simulated delay

This project contains one single service, but it can be reused
to simulate multiple endpoints. The service has an input for a
simulated delay (to simulate that different services have
different qualities when it comes to response time). The
link:../simple-service[``simple-service``] module
also has a webpage that can act as a client which can be reached
on http://localhost:8082.

The service is a regular REST service, and responds on the
URL http://localhost:8082/service and it requires 3 request
parameters

. ``queryString`` - The textual representation of input data, this
is echoed back
. ``instNo`` - The name of the endpoint (since we can emulate multiple endpoints)
. ``delay`` - A value for simulated delay

== Run
