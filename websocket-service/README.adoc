= WebSocket Service

Test proxy service that multiplexes incoming requests to multiple services, then
responds asynchronously via a web socket as soon as the services respond.

It has a list of simulated endpoints (simulated services, with simulated delays),
the class link:src/main/java/com/wixia/websocket/MultiProxyWebSocketHandler.java[MultiProxyWebSocketHandler] implements
a handler for the web socket and accepts incoming web socket connections.

This project is dependent on another project (or several others) to implement some
kind of service. There is an example project that can act as a service to this
project in the module link:../simple-service[``simple-service``].

== Run
